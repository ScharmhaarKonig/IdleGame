# Game Ideas
>This game is gonna be some kind of small browser game. Which you can play and sit on AFK like cookie clicker. 

## Basic Ideas 
1. You create your own character.
2. You choose a class and a world(which doesnt affect anything, basically no world is more OP than the other its just aesthetics).
3. Random bosses
4. Per level up new mobs
