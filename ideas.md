# Game Ideas
>This game is gonna be some kind of small cozy browser game. Which you can play and sit on AFK like cookie clicker. So nothing too crazy it means that everyone can play it. Sometimes we all need a game to relax a bit. 

## Basic Ideas 
1. You create your own character.
2. You choose a class and a world(which doesnt affect anything, basically no world is more OP than the other its just aesthetics).
3. Random bosses
4. Per level up new mobs
